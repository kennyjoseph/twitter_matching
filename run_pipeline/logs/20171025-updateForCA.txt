# modified generate_extra_files.py to have "states = ['CA']" instead of the list of 50.
# Create extra_state_files/CA_extra.tsv from the existing 50 files (from May)

# Create the 'ts_cleaned' version of CA:
lfriedl@achtung03:~/voter-stuff/voter-data$ mkdir ts_cleaned2
lfriedl@achtung03:~/voter-stuff/voter-data$ python ~/twitter_matching/voter_file_aggregation/code/generate_targetsmart_csvs.py targetsmart_oct2017 ts_cleaned2
# (Ran for > 1 hour, took lots of memory, generated ts_cleaned2/tsmart_northeastern_install_file_CA.tsv)
$ mv ts_cleaned2/tsmart_northeastern_install_file_CA.tsv ts_cleaned

# Run prepCountInputs.R to create the chunk files. 
# For safety, modify output directory to be ts_chunks2 when first run this. (Then moved results to regular ts_chunks.)
$ cd ~/twitter_matching/run_pipeline
$ Rscript prepCountInputs.R 5		# CA is the 5th when 1-indexed.

# Run runTS.R. 
# First need to edit the hard-coded number of files in ts_chunks --> since nothing else is in process,
# the change shouldn't break anything (apart from manual notes in some *.sh files mapping states to their numbers).
# Then, created file 'fullStates-withCA.sh' with command-line calls part 1, of the form 'Rscript runTS.R 8 1' for the CA chunk files, which have indices 8-20.
