Scripts to get the Twitter profiles into and back out of a mySQL database.

- ```db3.2.sql```: Defines the tables and loads Twitter data (.csv files that were generated by ../twitter_profiles_DB_prep)
- ```matchPeople3.R```: Iterates through voter file, querying DB for (up to 10) profiles with matching names and saving all data for these candidate matches.
- ```runInParallel.R```: Code that parallelizes the function in matchPeople3.R. (Partitions input file by line number, runs each chunk separately.)
